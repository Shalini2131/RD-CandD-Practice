## Terraform steps for execution
### ```terraform init``` -- This command is used to initialize the working directory containing Terraform configuration files  and installs the plugins.
### ```terraform plan``` -- After a successful initialization of the working directory and the completion of the plugin download, we can create an execution plan using terraform plan ### command, this is a handy way to check whether the execution plan matches your expectations without making any changes to real resources or to the state.
### If the Terraform discovers no changes to resources, then the terraform plan indicates that no changes are required to the real infrastructure.
### ```terraform apply``` --Terraform apply command is used to create or introduce changes to real infrastructure. By default, apply scans the current working directory for the ### configuration and applies the changes appropriately. However, youâ€™ll optionally give the path to a saved plan file that was previously created with terraform plan.
### If you do not provides a plan file on the instruction, terraform apply will create a replacement plan automatically then prompt for approval to use it. If the created plan  ### does not include any changes to resources or to root module output values then terraform apply will exit immediately, without prompting.
### ```terraform destroy``` -- this is used to destroy all your created infrastructure.
