### Here I am able to access my s3 bucket through cloudfront url.
#### My s3 bucket contains 2 files.
### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - index.html
### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - download.png
#### And the default page is set as index.html, which is why on loading cloudfront url we will get the index page.
